This guide helps you to set up LiveKit server on a virtual machine on AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean.

## Pre-requisites

To start, you'll need:

- A valid self-generated LiveKit API key, following the instructions in the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started#generate-api-key-and-secret) guide.
- A valid SSL certificate and private key, which can be purchased anywhere that sells SSL certificates such as [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/).
- Ability to add a DNS record pointing to your new LiveKit Server.

## Deploy with Cloud Init

This is the easiest method for deploying LiveKit Server. You can deploy a LiveKit Server using a vanilla Linux image and Cloud Init configuration file.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="aws"
  groupId="cloud"
  values={[
    {label: 'AWS', value: 'aws'},
    {label: 'Digital Ocean', value: 'do'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="aws">

LiveKit Server can be deployed with either Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu. Use the `cloud-init.<platform>.yaml` file corresponding to your desired platform:

- For Amazon Linux 2, use [cloud-init.amzn2.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livekit/livekit-server/master/deploy/cloud-init.amzn2.yaml)
- For Ubuntu, use [cloud-init.ubuntu.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livekit/livekit-server/master/deploy/cloud-init.ubuntu.yaml)

Steps:

1. Download one of the above `cloud-init.<platform>.yaml` files. Edit it to include your LiveKit Server configuration, SSL certificate, and SSL private key.
2. Open the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) and navigate to EC2.
3. Launch an instance.
4. Choose the latest "Amazon Linux 2" or "Ubuntu Server" AMI.
5. In the "Step 3: Configure Instance Details" screen, copy and paste text from your modified `cloud-init.yaml` file from step 1 into the "User data" field, under the "Advanced Details" section.
6. Launch your instance as usual.

Steps:

1. Download the [cloud-init.ubuntu.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livekit/livekit-server/master/deploy/cloud-init.ubuntu.yaml) file. Edit it to include your LiveKit Server configuration, SSL certificate, and SSL private key.
2. Log on to Digital Ocean and navigate to [Droplets](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets).
3. Create a Droplet.
4. Choose the latest "Ubuntu" image.
5. Under "Select additional options" section, check the "User data" option. Copy and paste text from your modified `cloud-init.ubuntu.yaml` file from step 1 into the "User data" field, under the "Advanced Details" section.
6. Launch your droplet as usual.

## Firewall

In addition to the [required ports](ports-firewall) listed above, you'll also want to open up the following ports:

- TCP 22   - SSH
- TPC 443  - SSL terminated WebSocket
- UDP 7882 - RTC UDP

## Troubleshooting

If something is not working as expected, SSH in to your server and use the following commands to investigate:

```
systemctl status docker.service
systemctl status nginx.service
systemctl status docker.livekit-server@v0.13.service
tail /var/log/nginx/access.log
tail /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
