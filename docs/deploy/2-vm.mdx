This guide helps you to set up production-ready LiveKit server on a virtual machine.

This configuration uses Docker Compose and Caddy. Your LiveKit server will support
a wide range of connectivity, including those behind VPN and firewalls (via TURN/TLS)

You do not need separate SSL certificates for this set up, we will provision them
automatically with Caddy.

## Pre-requisites

To start, you'll need:

- A domain that you control
- Ability to add DNS records for subdomains that point to your new LiveKit Server

## Generate configuration

Use our configuration generation tool to create a customized configuration for your domain.

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v$PWD:/output livekit/generate
```

You should have a folder with the following files:

* caddy.yaml
* docker-compose.yaml
* livekit.yaml
* redis.conf
* init_script.sh OR cloud_init.xxxx.yaml

## Deploy to a VM

Depending on your cloud provider, there are a couple of options

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cloud-init"
  groupId="cloud-deploy"
  values={[
    {label: 'Cloud Init', value: 'cloud-init'},
    {label: 'Startup Script', value: 'startup-script'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="cloud-init">

  This is the easiest method for deploying LiveKit Server. AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, and others support [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/).

  We have tested our scripts on Ubuntu and Amazon Linux, but it's possible that the same scripts may also work on other platforms.
  (Please let us know in Slack or open a PR!)

  When starting a VM, paste the contents of the file `cloud-init.xxxx.yaml` into the `User data` field.

  That's it, when the machine starts up, it'll execute the cloud-init protocol and install LiveKit

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="startup-script">

  We could also generate a startup script that can work when cloud-init isn't supported.

  This has been tested with Linode and Google Cloud.

  1. Start a VM as usual
  2. Copy the file `init_script.sh` to the VM
  3. ssh into the instance
  3. Run `sudo ./init_script.sh` to perform installation


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When the install script is finished, your instance should be set up. It will have installed

* docker
* docker-compose
* generated configuration to /opt/livekit
* systemd service `livekit-docker`

To start/stop the service you could use systemctl:

```shell
systemctl stop livekit-docker

systemctl start livekit-docker
```

## Firewall

Ensure that the following ports are open on your firewall and accessible on the instance:

 * 443 - primary HTTPS and TURN/TLS
 * 80 - TLS issuance
 * 7881 - WebRTC over TCP
 * 443/UDP - TURN/UDP
 * 50000-60000/UDP - WebRTC over UDP

## DNS

Ensure both primary domain and TURN domain are pointed at the IP address of your instance.

This is required in order for Caddy to start provisioning your TLS certificates.

## Troubleshooting

If something is not working as expected, SSH in to your server and use the following commands to investigate:

```shell
systemctl status livekit-docker
cd /opt/livekit
sudo docker-compose logs
```
